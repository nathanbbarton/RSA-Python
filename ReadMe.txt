RSA Crypto in a Terminal App

!!!!!NOTICE VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!

!!!!I REPEAT VERY IMPORTANT!!!!

THIS WAS CODED IN PYTHON 3 

From working on this project I found there are serious compatability issues between python2 and python3
I have coded and compiled this based on python3. Main compatability issue for my program is python 3's 
usage of "non local". Allowing a variable to look at info outside of its scope. 

Python 3 can be downloaded at https://www.python.org/downloads/

I am running this on a Apple Macbook pro
I have added the she-bang #!/usr/bin/env python3
But python 3 will still be needed
With the python3 download there is a script it comes with to make python3 run as default, That's what I have done
but understand if it's not the best option for your system.

When executing this is the system version I have
3.0.1 (r301:69597, Feb 14 2009, 19:03:52) 
[GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5490)]

If there are any confusions, or problems please contact me and I will be happy to try to help and or 
come in to show you my code again.


-The program is a fairly simple single file python script
-Uses a simple number selection terminal based GUI to encrypt and decrypt messages
-Before you can encrypt you must go to option 2. Your info and generate a new key
-It wipes all info every time you rerun the program so no new keys will be saved between executions
